# Game of Life

### Definition 
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of  which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which  are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.  
### Rules 
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:  
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by underpopulation.  
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.  
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.  
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.  
The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the  above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the  discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a  pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further  generations.  

## Setup

### Docker

**Before run project in docker needed:**
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Clone project.
- [_Skip for macOS users_] Create the docker group if it does not exist `sudo groupadd docker`
- [_Skip for macOS users_] Add your user to the docker group. `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- [_Skip for macOS users_] Run the following command or Logout and login again and run (that doesn't work you may need to reboot your machine first) `newgrp docker`
- Run `docker-compose up -d`.

### Run Game
`docker-compose run --rm php -f /app/index.php`
